# ðŸŽ¹ AI-Enhanced Virtual Piano with Voice Assistance

This project implements a smart virtual piano with:
- Hand gesture recognition (via camera)
- Keyboard play
- Voice-controlled commands
- Built-in AI that predicts the next note using a trained RNN model
- Preloaded songs like *Happy Birthday* and *Twinkle Twinkle*
